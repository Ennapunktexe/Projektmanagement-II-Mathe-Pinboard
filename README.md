Currently the website only works with xampp, because we built it on xampp.
If u want to test it just download the whole folder and put the mathPinboard folder (where all the files are in) into the htdocs folder of xampp. Start xampp apache as admin and then go into you browser and type "http://localhost/mathPinboard/startseite.html" into the URL. The test topics should be deleted. These are only for github so that the folder apears.
